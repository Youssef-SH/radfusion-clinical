# Architecture

## Terminology

- **Dataset:** an external source collection with a stable logical identity.
- **Build:** one execution of bundle construction. A successful build publishes one bundle.
- **Bundle:** an immutable, validated set of typed artifacts stored under `build-<sha256>`.
- **Manifest:** `rsna_manifest_metadata.json`, the bundle document that declares identity,
  contents, hashes, policies, and provenance. The `rsna-manifest` command runs a build.

The lifecycle is: source dataset → build execution → immutable bundle → validated consumers.
`CURRENT` selects the active bundle; published bundles remain immutable.

## Component boundaries

| Component | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Source adapter | Parse source tables, discover DICOM files, and extract selected headers |
| Artifact builder | Normalize typed records and construct patient-level assignments |
| Validator | Enforce schemas, relationships, paths, identities, and ordering |
| Bundle publisher | Publish immutable bundles and update `CURRENT` atomically |
| Audit generator | Produce aggregate dataset reports from a validated bundle |
| Dataset mapping | Resolve the built-in adapter for a pinned bundle |
| Model mapping | Resolve the built-in metadata estimator adapter |
| Tabular runner | Fit on train and select operating thresholds on validation |
| Test evaluator | Apply a completed training run to the test partition |
| Evaluation utilities | Compute probabilities, metrics, thresholds, latency, and plots |

Dataset adapters isolate source-specific behavior. Training reads validated bundles through the
dataset mapping. Model adapters own estimator construction and fitting.

The manifest owns dataset, task, split, source, and artifact lineage. Parquet tables contain
row-level facts, while audits contain derived descriptions. `CURRENT` selects a bundle for
interactive commands; experiment configs pin an exact bundle ID.

Model packages under `models/` and complete reports under `reports/` are the authoritative
physical outputs. MLflow stores the run ledger and references to those outputs; see
[`training.md`](training.md) for the experiment artifact contract.

## Data flow

```text
RSNA source files
    → dataset adapter
    → validated tables and manifest
    → immutable bundle
    → audit, tabular training, or explicit test evaluation
    → bundle-qualified audits or run-qualified experiment outputs
```

Artifact schemas are defined in [`data_contract.md`](data_contract.md). Experiment composition is
defined in [`training.md`](training.md). Reconstruction and evaluation protocols are defined in
[`reproducibility.md`](reproducibility.md).
