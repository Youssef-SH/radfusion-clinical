# Experiments

Each executable experiment is defined by one strict YAML file:

```yaml
config_version: 1
name: metadata_logistic_regression

dataset:
  registry_key: rsna
  manifest_directory: data/manifests
  bundle_id: build-<sha256>
  task_id: pneumonia

model:
  registry_key: metadata_logistic
  parameters: {}
  fit_parameters: {}

training:
  seed: 42
  report_directory: reports
  model_directory: models/rsna

evaluation:
  sensitivity_target: 0.90
  calibration_bins: 15
  latency_warmup_calls: 100
  latency_measured_calls: 1000

mlflow:
  experiment_name: radfusion-rsna
```

The loader rejects missing, unknown, and duplicate keys. Each experiment names an exact immutable
bundle ID. `training.seed` is the single randomness authority.

All executable configs use schema version 1. They are `configs/metadata_logistic.yaml`,
`configs/metadata_lightgbm.yaml`, and `configs/image_densenet.yaml`.

## Feature boundary

The RSNA adapter exposes these model features:

- `age_years`
- `age_is_implausible`
- `sex`
- `view_position`
- `pixel_spacing_row_mm`
- `pixel_spacing_col_mm`

Preprocessing rejects additional columns. Sample IDs, patient IDs, image paths, targets,
partitions, and lineage remain separate from the feature frame. Imputation, categories,
missingness indicators, scaling, and class weighting are derived from training data.
The model package records this ordered input contract, its type categories and missing-value
semantics, and the policy version. The fitted preprocessing pipeline is embedded in
`model.skops`.

## Execution

```bash
make train CONFIG=configs/metadata_logistic.yaml
make train CONFIG=configs/image_densenet.yaml
make evaluate RUN_ID=<training-run-id>
make compare
```

`<training-run-id>` denotes the run ID printed by `make train`.

Training validates the complete pinned bundle, then performs projected and filtered reads for
train and validation only. It fits preprocessing and the estimator on train, uses validation for
LightGBM early stopping, selects both operating thresholds on validation, and publishes the fitted
model.

Test evaluation is a separate run. Before reading test data, it validates the package and its
semantic ID, lineage to the source training run, configuration and model hashes, fitted input
contract, validation-derived choices, and LightGBM best iteration. Formal evaluation accepts
packages from clean training commits and requires the evaluator to use the same clean Git commit
and dependency lock. It then reads only test and applies the verified choices unchanged.

The built-in dataset and model adapters are held in immutable mappings. One tabular runner owns
metadata training, one neural runner owns image training, and the explicit evaluator owns test
evaluation. Dispatch is determined by `model.modality`.

## Image training

The image configuration defines one seed, the fixed TorchXRayVision DenseNet121 encoder, source
dataset root, deterministic loading policy, augmentation, optimization stages, and runtime policy.
Each invocation trains one seed. Training validates the pinned bundle, loads only train and
validation rows, and authenticates their DICOM size and SHA-256 against the source inventory before
constructing datasets or the model.

The image configuration pins the immutable semantic bundle ID. Bundle validation computes the
observed bundle-manifest SHA-256 and verifies its physical, logical, semantic, split, and source
contracts. Training freezes that exact identity in the model package and copies it to an MLflow
parameter; linked evaluation requires the same bundle-manifest SHA-256 before test access.
Authorized train/validation and test source-authentication proofs retain distinct row digests.

### Pretrained weight file and provenance

TorchXRayVision normally obtains `densenet121-res224-chex` under
`~/.torchxrayvision/models_data/`; offline runs must prepare the URL-derived cache file there.
Image training requires that entry to be a regular non-symlink file, fingerprints it immediately
before and after model construction, and requires exact equality. This establishes local run
provenance but does not independently authenticate the file against an official upstream digest.
Test evaluation reconstructs with `weights=None` and loads only the packaged trained state.

Training performs head-only warm-up followed by full fine-tuning. Validation Average Precision
selects the retained state across both stages and controls fine-tuning scheduling and early
stopping. Final deterministic validation inference freezes the Youden-J and target-sensitivity
thresholds. Test rows, labels, files, and pixels remain outside the training lifecycle.
Epoch history records the learning rates used during each epoch, before scheduling the next epoch.

Runtime selection supports CPU and CUDA. Mixed precision and pinned-memory transfer become
effective only on CUDA when requested. DataLoader shuffle, worker randomness, model initialization,
and augmentation derive from `training.seed`. CUDA runtime, cuDNN, GPU device, and compute
capability are recorded as non-semantic runtime provenance.

Image packages contain:

```text
models/rsna/runs/<training-run-id>/
  model.pt
  resolved_config.yaml
  model_manifest.json
```

`model.pt` is a validated CPU tensor state dictionary with selection metadata. The package manifest
binds the checkpoint, path-independent experiment meaning, archived configuration, dataset and
split lineage, source authentication, pretrained-weight byte identity, transform contracts,
training policy, selected validation state, and frozen thresholds. The evaluator validates this
package, reconstructs the DenseNet architecture without loading the original TorchXRayVision
cache, and strictly loads the complete state before reading or authenticating test data.

## Tracking and outputs

Model packages under `models/` and complete reports under `reports/` are the authoritative
physical outputs. MLflow stores the run ledger, status, parameters, scalar metrics, provenance,
lineage, completion state, references to project-owned outputs, and the exact loaded training
configuration. Run metadata lives in `mlflow.db`; training configuration artifacts live under
`mlartifacts/`. Inspect local runs with:

```bash
uv run mlflow server --backend-store-uri sqlite:///mlflow.db
```

A training run logs the exact loaded YAML before dataset access and records resolved split and
label-policy lineage before fitting. Training and test-evaluation runs become complete only after
their local run-qualified outputs are published. Training runs publish model packages; test runs
link to their source training runs and publish test reports.

Local training packages contain:

```text
models/rsna/runs/<training-run-id>/
  model.skops
  resolved_config.yaml
  model_manifest.json
```

Image packages use the same hierarchy with `model.pt` in place of `model.skops`.

The manifest records `model_package_schema_version` and a deterministic `model_package_id`. Image
package identity includes the selected checkpoint and observed bundle-manifest SHA-256, making it
an exact provenance identity. Runtime provenance, operational paths, and training-run ID remain
outside this identity; the archived configuration retains exact byte-hash validation.

Dirty training runs may publish traceable packages, but those packages are ineligible for formal
test evaluation. Test-evaluation runs record their own Git and dependency provenance, the model
package ID, and their source training run.

Each training or test-evaluation run publishes aggregate reports under
`reports/rsna/runs/<run-id>/`:

```text
metrics.json
evaluation_report.md
confusion_summary.md
roc_curve.png
precision_recall_curve.png
calibration_curve.png
confusion_matrix_youden_j.png
confusion_matrix_target_sensitivity.png
```

Publication requires exactly this set after privacy validation. `make compare` deterministically
regenerates `reports/model_comparison_table.csv` and `.md` from complete, finite MLflow records.
Rows include modality, task, and model package identity. Image rows are published only for verified
test-evaluation runs; failed, unfinished, and incomplete runs are excluded.

The training, evaluation, and comparison CLIs default to `sqlite:///mlflow.db` and accept
`--tracking-uri` when an isolated local SQLite database is required.

Metric definitions and experimental protocols are documented in
[`reproducibility.md`](reproducibility.md).
